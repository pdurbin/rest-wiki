# Contributing to the REST Wiki

The sources for this wiki comes from a Git repository with a bunch of
Markdown files. There are many ways to contribute:

1. Create an issue describing what you would like to have improved.
   [Create a new issue](https://github.com/trygvis/rest-wiki/issues/new).
1. Edit the content in you local clone and create a pull request
   [Create a pull request](https://github.com/trygvis/rest-wiki/pulls).

## Building locally

You don't need to do this to contribute, but sometimes it is useful to
preview your changes

    $ git clone https://github.com/trygvis/rest-wiki
    $ ./rebuild.sh
    $ gnome-open ../rest-wiki-html/index.html

If you just want to check the Markdown layout of a single page, it
might be easier to just use tools like `markdown`:

    $ markdown index.mdwn > index.html
    $ gnome-open index.html

If you want to rebuild it with the same theme as used at the published
site, clone the theme first:

    $ cd ..
    $ git clone https://github.com/ramseydsilva/ikiwiki-bootstrap-theme
    $ cd rest-wiki
    $ ./rebuild.sh

Note that for this to work you need to view the generated site through
a HTTP hosted site so that all references to Bootstrap and JQuery are
properly resolved.
